	<p>serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more people,
        usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification, with the
        murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant
        period of time between them. While most authorities set a threshold of
        three murders,others extend it to four or lessen it to two.
        Psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing, and
        most serial killings involve sexual contact with the victim,but the
        Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that the motives of serial
        killers can include anger, thrill-seeking, financial gain, and attention
        seeking. The murders may be attempted or completed in a similar fashion.
        The victims may have something in common, for example, demographic
        profile, appearance, gender or race. Although a serial killer is a
        distinct classification that differs from that of a mass murderer, spree
        killer, or contract killer, there may be conceptual overlaps between
        them and some debate exists on specific qualifications, especially with
        regard to spree killers in comparison to serial killers.
