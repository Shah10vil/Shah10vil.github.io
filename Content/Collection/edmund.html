          Serial killer Edmund Kemper killed six young women in the Santa Cruz,
          California, area and several members of his family.
        </p>
        <h2>Who Is Edmund Kemper?</h2>
        <p>
          Edmund Kemper, at age 15, killed both his grandparents to "see what it
          felt like." Upon release, he drifted, picking up and releasing female
          hitchhikers. But he soon stopped letting them go, killing six young
          women in the Santa Cruz, California, area in the 1970s. In 1973 he
          killed his mother and her friend before turning himself in.
        </p>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Kemper was born on December 18, 1948, in Burbank, California, the
          middle child of E. E. and Clarnell Kemper. After his parents’ divorce
          in 1957, he moved with his mother and two sisters to Montana. Kemper
          had a difficult relationship with his alcoholic mother, as she was
          very critical of him, and he blamed her for all of his problems. When
          he was 10 years old, she forced him to live in the basement, away from
          his sisters, whom she feared he might harm in some way. Signs of
          trouble began to emerge early. Kemper had a dark fantasy life,
          sometimes dreaming about killing his mother. He cut off the heads of
          his sisters' dolls and even coerced the girls into playing a game he
          called "gas chamber," in which he had them blindfold him and lead him
          to a chair, where he pretended to writhe in agony until he "died." His
          first victims were the family cats. At ten he, buried one of them
          alive and the second, 13 year-old Kemper slaughtered with a knife. He
          went to live with his father for a time, but ended up back with his
          mother, who decided to send the troubled teenager to live with his
          paternal grandparents in North Fork, California.
        </p>
        <h2>Grandparents' Murder</h2>
        <p>
          Kemper hated living on his grandparents' farm. Before going to North
          Fork, he had already begun learning about firearms, but his
          grandparents took away his rifle after he killed several birds and
          other small animals. On August 27, 1964, Kemper finally turned his
          building rage on his grandparents. The 15-year-old shot his
          grandmother in the kitchen after an argument, and when his grandfather
          returned home, Kemper went outside and shot him by his car and then
          hid the body. Afterward, he called his mother, who told him to call
          the police and tell them what happened. Later, Kemper would say that
          he shot his grandmother "to see what it felt like." He added that he
          had killed his grandfather so that the man wouldn't have to find out
          that his wife had been murdered. For his crimes, Kemper was handed
          over to the California Youth Authority. He underwent a variety of
          tests, which determined that he had a very high IQ, but also suffered
          from paranoid schizophrenia. Kemper was eventually sent to Atascadero
          State Hospital, a maximum-security facility for mentally ill convicts.
        </p>
        <h2>Release</h2>
        <p>
          In 1969, Kemper was released at the age of 21. Despite his prison
          doctors' recommendation that he does not live with his mother, because
          of her past abuse and his psychological issues involving her, he
          rejoined her in Santa Cruz, California, where she had moved after
          ending her third marriage to take a job with the University of
          California. While there, Kemper attended community college for a time
          and worked a variety of jobs, eventually finding employment with the
          Department of Transportation in 1971. Kemper had applied to become a
          state trooper, but he was rejected because of his size — he weighed
          around 300 pounds and was 6 feet 9 inches tall, which led to his
          nickname “Big Ed.” However, he did hang around some of the Santa Cruz
          police officers. One gave him a training-school badge and handcuffs,
          while another let him borrow a gun, according to Whoever Fights
          Monsters by Robert K. Ressler and Tom Shachtman. Kemper even had a car
          that resembled a police cruiser. The same year he began working for
          the highway department, Kemper was hit by a car while out on his
          motorcycle. His arm was badly injured, and he received a $15,000
          settlement in the civil suit he filed against the car’s driver. Unable
          to work, Kemper turned his mind toward other pursuits. He noticed a
          large number of young women hitchhiking in the area. In the new car he
          bought with some of his settlement money, Kemper began storing the
          tools he thought he might need to fulfill his murderous desires,
          including a gun, a knife and handcuffs.
        </p>
        <h2>'The Co-ed Killer'</h2>
        <p>
          At first, Kemper picked up female hitchhikers and let them go.
          However, when he offered a ride to two Fresno State students — Mary
          Ann Pesce and Anita Luchessa — they would never make it to their
          destination. Their families reported them missing soon thereafter, but
          nothing would be known of their fates until August 15, when a female
          head was discovered in the woods near Santa Cruz and was later
          identified as Pesce’s. Luchessa’s remains, however, were never found.
          Kemper would later explain that he stabbed and strangled Pesce before
          stabbing Luchessa as well. After the murders, he brought the bodies
          back to his apartment and removed their heads and hands. Kemper also
          reportedly engaged in sexual activity with their corpses. Later that
          year, on September 14, 1972, Kemper picked up 15-year-old Aiko Koo,
          who had decided to hitchhike rather than wait for the bus to take her
          to a dance class. She would meet the same fate as Pesce and Luchessa.
          In January 1973, Kemper continued to act on his murderous impulses,
          picking up hitchhiker Cindy Schall, whom he shot and killed. While his
          mother was out, Kemper went to her home and hid Schall’s body in his
          room. He dismembered her corpse there the following day and threw the
          parts into the ocean. Several parts were later discovered when they
          washed up onshore. He buried her head in his mother's backyard. On
          February 5, 1973, Kemper used a campus parking sticker his mother had
          given him to facilitate a double-murder. He drove to the university,
          where he offered a ride to two students, Rosalind Thorpe and Alice
          Liu. Shortly after picking them up, he shot the two young women then
          drove past the campus security at the gates with the two mortally
          wounded women in his car. After the murders, Kemper decapitated his
          two victims and further dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets
          from their heads and disposed of their parts in different locations.
          In March, some of Thorpe’s and Liu’s remains were discovered by hikers
          near Highway 1 in San Mateo County. At the time of Kemper's murders,
          two other serial killers, John Linley Frazier and Herbert Mullins were
          also perpetuating their own crimes in the area, resulting in Santa
          Cruz receiving the ignominious nickname the “Murder Capital of the
          World” in the press. For Kemper's part, he was dubbed the “Co-ed
          Killer” and the “Co-ed Butcher.”
        </p>
        <h2>Mother's Murder</h2>
        <p>
          In April 1973, Kemper committed what would be his last two murders. On
          Good Friday, he went to his mother’s home, where the two had an
          unpleasant exchange. Kemper attacked his mother after she went to
          sleep, first striking her in the head with a hammer, and then cutting
          her throat with a knife. As he had with his other victims, he then
          decapitated her and cut off her hands, but then also removed her
          larynx and put it down the garbage disposal. After hiding his mother's
          body parts, Kemper called his mother’s, friend Sally Hallett and
          invited her over to the house. Kemper strangled Hallett shortly after
          she arrived and hid her body in a closet. Kemper fled the area the
          next day, driving east until he reached Pueblo, Colorado, where on
          April 23 he made a call to the Santa Cruz police to confess his
          crimes. At first, they did not believe that the guy they knew as “Big
          Ed” was a killer. But during subsequent interrogations, he would lead
          them to all the evidence they needed to prove that he was in fact the
          infamous "Co-ed Killer."
        </p>
        <h2>Trial and Imprisonment</h2>
        <p>
          Charged with eight counts of first-degree murder, Kemper went on trial
          for his crimes in October 1973. He was found guilty of all of the
          charges in early November. When asked by the judge what he thought his
          punishment should be, Kemper said that he should be tortured to death.
          He instead received eight concurrent life sentences. At present,
          Kemper is serving his time at California Medical Facility in
          Vacaville.
