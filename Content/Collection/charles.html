          Charles Manson was an American cult leader whose followers carried out
          several notorious murders in the late 1960s, resulting in his life
          imprisonment. He died in 2017 after spending more than four decades in
          prison.
        </p>
        <h2>Who Was Charles Manson?</h2>
        <p>
          Charles Manson was an American criminal who spearheaded a murderous
          campaign with his followers, the Manson Family cult, that would make
          him one of the most infamous figures in criminal history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notorious for his connection to the brutal slayings of pregnant
          actress Sharon Tate and other Hollywood residents, Manson received the
          death penalty in 1971, a sentence that was commuted to life in prison
          the following year.
        </p>
        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Manson was born Charles Milles Maddox on November 12, 1934, in
          Cincinnati, Ohio, to Kathleen Maddox, a 16-year-old girl who was both
          an alcoholic and a prostitute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kathleen later married William Manson, but the marriage ended quickly
          and Charles was placed in a boys school at age 12. Rejected in his
          attempts to return to his mother, Charles was soon living on the
          streets and getting by through petty crime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the next 20 years, Manson spent time in and out of reform schools
          and prisons for various crimes. He was released from prison on March
          21, 1967, and moved to San Francisco.
        </p>
        <h2>The Manson Family Cult</h2>
        <p>
          "The Family" was a group of around 100 followers of Manson who shared
          his passion for an unconventional lifestyle and habitual use of
          hallucinogenic drugs, such as LSD and magic mushrooms. The Manson
          Family eventually moved from San Francisco to a deserted ranch in the
          San Fernando Valley. Manson’s followers also included a small,
          hard-core unit of impressionable young girls. They began to believe,
          without question, Manson's claims that he was Jesus and his prophecies
          of a race war.
        </p>
        <h2>Murders and Victims</h2>
        <p>
          The Manson Family — including Manson and his young, loyal disciples —
          is thought to have carried out some 35 killings. Most of their cases
          were never tried, in part for lack of evidence. The perpetrators had
          also already been sentenced to life for the killings on August 9, 1969
          (Tate, writer Wojciech Frykowski, his partner, coffee bean heiress
          Abigail Folger and celebrity hairstylist Jay Sebring) and two more
          victims on August 10, 1969 (wealthy supermarket executive Leno
          LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary).
        </p>
        <p>
          In August 1969, Manson gathered a group of his most loyal Family
          followers to carry out his massacre among Hollywood's elite and
          "beautiful people." The first of Manson’s victims was murdered at the
          home Polanski had rented, located at 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict
          Canyon, an area just north of Beverly Hills. Polanski was away in
          London shooting a film., and the four victims had just returned home
          from dinner at the time of the murder.
        </p>
        <h2>'Arrest and Trial'</h2>
        <p>
          Ironically, Manson and his Family were arrested not on suspicion of
          the Tate-LaBianca murders, but simply on the belief that they had
          vandalized a portion of the Death Valley National Park while they were
          hiding out in the Mojave Desert.
        </p>
        <p>
          n 1969, the county sheriff had taken them into custody, not realizing
          that they were involved in the heinous murders. But it was through the
          confession of Susan Atkins, while held in detention on suspicion of
          murdering Gary Hinman during an unrelated incident, that led
          detectives to realize that Manson and his followers were involved in
          the killings
        </p>
        <p>
          Various motivations were examined during the course of the trial. The
          most feasible was that Manson's pathological ego, insanity and belief
          in Armageddon were influences that led him to leave behind a trail of
          destruction. Manson believed that he was the new Messiah, and that
          after a "nuclear attack" he and his followers would be saved by hiding
          in a secret world under the desert.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later in court, Van Houten, who was just 19 when she took part in the
          LaBianca killings, alleged that Manson had taken advantage of her
          vulnerability and dislike for her mother, although she believed, like
          the other members, that he was a man of vision. Thirty years later,
          during a parole board hearing, Van Houten said she was horrified by
          what she had done that night and desperately wanted to redeem herself.
          She was denied parole in 2006 and again in 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kasabian was granted immunity for her part as star witness. Susan
          Atkins was sentenced to death, but her sentence was later commuted to
          life in prison. She was incarcerated from 1969 until her death in
          2009.

        <h2>Children and Wives</h2>
        <p>
          In 1955, between prison sentences, Manson married Rosalie Jean Willis,
          a 17-year-old hospital waitress. The couple moved to California and
          had a son, Charles Manson Jr., who committed suicide in the 1990s. By
          1956, Willis had left with their child to be with her new lover, and
          she later divorced Manson. 1959, Manson married a prostitute, Leona
          Rae “Candy” Stevens, with whom he had a second son, Charles Luther
          Manson. Stevens divorced Manson in 1963.
        </p>
        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          Manson died on November 19, 2017, of natural causes. He had been in
          prison for more than 40 years for his crimes. Days earlier, Manson had
          been admitted to a hospital in Bakersfield, California; however, no
          details about his medical condition or his location were disclosed,
          due to privacy and security reasons. The longtime prisoner had also
          been hospitalized earlier in the year. Manson had been serving time in
          Corcoran State Prison in California since 1971. In 2012, He was denied
          parole for the 12th time.
